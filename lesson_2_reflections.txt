What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	To initialize a repository you go to the desired location (folder that you want to become a repository) and type <git init> into the terminal

	This creates a .git file in your folder that we can view with <ls -a>
	We need to initialize a repository to set up the enviroment that we need to make commits and start version control on those files.
